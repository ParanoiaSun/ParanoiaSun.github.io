description: 上了大学才知道电脑的便捷的重要性，喜打游戏的我就想着买个大屏性能好的笔记本。后来每天拎着这笨重的笔记本指节那边都有像茧子一样的痕迹了，最近也是在做护手的工作，最近也是在做护手的工作，最近也是在做护手的工作，最近也是在做护手的工作.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
